# gvAPP coronagraph design for Magellan AO

Design by David Doelman.

Currently used in the Clio2 camera used with the Magellan telescope and
Adaptive Optics system for the thermal infrared.

The design is for a circular pupil with a secondary obscuration.

The secondary support structures (a.k.a. the spider arms) are not included in the design, so there will be diffraction
spikes due to the spider arms.

    mapp1_aperture.fits
    mapp1_phase.fits

are the telescope aperture and the phase aberrations for the pupil
respectively.
